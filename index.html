            <h2>Our Initiative</h2>
            <p>We are a group of passionate individuals dedicated to making quality education accessible to everyone, regardless of their background. Our mission is to break down barriers to education by providing resources, mentorship, and community-driven learning.</p>
            <p>
            Education should be accessible to everyone, but many students face challenges due to high costs and limited resources. Our initiative provides free video lectures, e-books, study materials, and mentorship programs to bridge this gap. We aim to create a supportive learning community where students can seek guidance and engage in discussions. Understanding internet limitations, we also offer offline learning options. As first-year learners, we know this is just the beginning. With future improvements like AI-driven recommendations and mobile accessibility, we strive to make education free, structured, and available to all.

        <h2>The Problem: Unequal Access to Education</h2>
        <p>Millions of students worldwide struggle to access quality education due to several challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Internet & Infrastructure:</strong> Many rural areas lack stable or affordable internet, making digital learning inaccessible.</li>
            <li><strong>High Cost of Educational Tools:</strong> Not everyone can afford essential learning devices like laptops or tablets.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Barriers:</strong> A significant portion of online educational material is available only in English, excluding non-English speakers.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Digital Literacy:</strong> Many students and even teachers are unfamiliar with digital learning platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Gaps in Education:</strong> Underprivileged schools often lack qualified teachers and updated learning materials.</li>
        </ul>
